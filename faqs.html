      The first Primrose School opened in 1982 by Paul and Marcy Erwin. It was opened in Marietta, GA. Since then,Primrose has become a huge part of many people's childhoods and one of the best recognized pre-schools in the country. They strive to provide the best early childhood education that one can possibly have.  The school we have decided to work with is the Primrose School of Johns Creek Northwest. The school is owned by Charles and Pushpa Mopur and the director is Karen Bednar.
